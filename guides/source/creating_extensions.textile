h2. Creating Extensions

This guide covers the technical details of extensions and is oriented towards developers. See the "customization guide":customization.html for a more basic treatment on how to customize Spree.

After this guide you should understand:

* The important role extensions play in Spree
* How to install a third party extension
* How to write your own custom extensions
* How to share your extensions with others

h3. Getting Started

Spree comes with a handy generator for creating a new Spree application.  If you are creating the extension within the context of a Rails application with the Spree gem enabled then this is a breeze.  If you wanted to create a new extension called "foofah" you would create as follows:

<shell>
  $ rails g spree:extension foofah
</shell>

This creates a directory named +foofah+ with all of the necessary files.  It will also automatically modify your +Gemfile+ so that its including the newly created engine/gem.

INFO: For information on testing your extension, please see the "Testing Guide":testing.html#testing-your-extensions.

h4. Sharing Your Extension

h5. Publishing Your Source

The first order of business is to get your extension on "Github":http://github.com where everybody can see it.  Most importantly, you will want to allow others to have access to the source code.  Github provides a convenient (and free) place to store your source code along with the ability to track issues and accept code patches.

INFO: It is convention to use the +spree-+ naming convention for your Github repository and +spree_+ for your gem name.  So for example, if you are creating a "foofah" extension the Github project would be named +spree-foofah+ and the gem would be +spree_fofoah+.

h5. Publishing Your Gem

If your extension is ready to be released into the wild you can publish it as a gem on "RubyGems.org":http://rubygems.org.  Assuming you used the extension generator to build your extension, its already a gem and ready to be published.  You'll just want to edit a few details before you proceed.

s.name        = 'foofah'
s.version     = '1.0.0'
s.summary     = 'Add gem summary here'
#s.description = 'Add (optional) gem description here'
s.required_ruby_version = '>= 1.8.7'

# s.author            = 'David Heinemeier Hansson'
# s.email             = 'david@loudthinking.com'
# s.homepage          = 'http://www.rubyonrails.org'
# s.rubyforge_project = 'actionmailer'

h4. Versionfile

Spree is moving at a rapid pace with the code constantly evolving as new releases are being pushed out.  These changes sometimes make it difficult to keep track of which version of Spree is compatible with which version of an extension. To solve this problem extension authors are encouraged to add a +Versionfile+ to their extension.

h5. Versionfile Basics

+Versionfile+ is a plain text file which keeps information about which version of Spree an extension is compatible with.  It was inspired by the +Gemfile+ used by bundler.  Lets take a look at a sample +Versionfile+.

<ruby>
"0.50.x" => { :branch => "master" }
"0.40.x" => { :tag => "v1.0.0", :version => "1.0.0" }
</ruby>

The above +Versionfile+ is saying that if you are using Spree version "0.50.x" then use "master" branch. If you are using Spree version "0.40.x" then you should use tag "v1.0.0".

You should note that we are dealing with two different concepts of "version" here.  One is the version of Spree supported and the other is the version of the extension.

INFO: All Spree extensions should have a version.  This version number has nothing to do with what version of Spree is supported.  It is listed purely as a convenient way to refer to an extension.  For example "I'm having a problem with spree_active_shipping 1.0.1"

h5. Syntax

A +Versionfile+ can have any number of lines. It is recommended that you put the latest Spree releases at the top. The very first thing a line should should is the Spree version it is supporting. Next within curly braces how to get extension supporting the specified Spree version is mentioned.

There are four different ways of specifying an extension's compatibilty information.

NOTE: All four variations for identifying extension compatibility can be mapped to more than one Spree version.  In other words, its entirely possible that the same version of an extension can be compatible with multiple versions of Spree.

*Gem Version*

<ruby>
"0.30.x" => { :version => "1.2" }
</ruby>

Above case is saying that if you are using Spree version "0.30.x" then use extension as a gem and the version of gem you should be using is "1.2".

Gem versions are considered "stable."  They will show up in the extension registry as such.

*Git Branch*

<ruby>
"0.30.x" => { :branch => "0-30-stable" }
</ruby>

Above case is telling that if you are using Spree version "0.30.x" then use branch named "0-30-stable". Notice that when you suggesting to use "branch" then "version" should not be specified.

Versions identified by Git branch are considered "unstable" or "edge."  They will be identified as such in the extension registry.

*Git Tag*

<ruby>
"0.30.x" => { :tag => "v0.30", :version => '1.1' }
</ruby>

Above case is suggesting that if you are using Spree version "0.30.x" then use tag named "v0.30". The version information indicates that the author of the extension is calling that release as version "1.1".

Versions identified by tags are considered "stable."  They will show up in the extension registry as such.  This is also a nice alternative to having to release an extension as an actual gem.

*Git SHA*

<ruby>
"0.30.x" => { :ref => "4aedfg", :version => '1.2' }
</ruby>

Above case is suggesting that if you are using Spree version "0.30.x" then use ref named "4aedfg" . The version information indicates that the author of the extension is calling that release as version "1.2"

Versions identified by a Git SHA are considered "stable."  They will show up in the extension registry as such.  This is also a nice alternative to having to release an extension as an actual gem.

<ruby>
#"0.30.x" => { :ref => "4aedfg", :version => '1.2' }
</ruby>

Above case is indicating how you can comment out a line. A line beginning with hash "#" is treated as comment.

h5. Using the Versionfile

+Versionfile+ has no impact on the actual ability of an extension to work with Spree.  It is simply a declaration by the extension author that a certain version of the extension is known to work with a particular version(s) of Spree.  Its also possible that an extension version might be compatible with versions of Spree not listed.  If you discover this to be the case please send a pull request to the extension author so they can update their +Versionfile+.

There is a crawler which crawls the +Versionfile+ of all the registered extensions once every day. So any changes you make to your extension's +Versionfile+ should be captured within 24 hours.

INFO: You must actually register your extension in the "Extension Registry":http://spreecommerce.com/extensions before it can be discovered by the crawler.

After the +Versionfile+ info has been processed you will see it listed in the "Extension Registry":http://spreecommerce.com/extensions.  Depending on the syntax you used to specify the version you will see it listed under "Stable Release" or "Dev Release".  In both cases there will also be a link labeled "Show". Clicking that link will show you the exact information you need to paste into your +Gemfile+ in order to use the extension.

h5. Troubleshooting

While parsing the lines gathered from +Versionfile+ if a line is invalid then that line is skipped. So make sure that entries in +Versionfile+ are valid. Soon we would be releasing a tool that can verify the +Versionfile+ and provide instant feedback if something is not right.

h4. Testing Against a Release Candidate

The Spree core team will often announce a so-called "release candidate":http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_release_life_cycle#Release_candidate shortly before an official release.  This is to allow Spree developers to test their sites and extensions against the upcoming release code.

In order to test your extension against the release candidate you will need to first update your gemspec file.  Lets look at how we would update the "spree_social":http://github.com/spree/spree_social gem to use the new 0.60.0.RC1 version of Spree.  We'll need to modify +spree_social.gemspec+ as follows:

<ruby>
Gem::Specification.new do |s|
  ...
  s.add_dependency('spree_core', '>= 0.60.0.RC1')
  s.add_dependency('spree_auth', '>= 0.60.0.RC1')
  ...
end
</ruby>

You'll also want to update your +Gemfile+ that belongs to the Spree application using the extension.

<ruby>
  gem 'spree', '0.60.0.RC1'
</ruby>

Next, you'll need to update the dependencies locally using bundler and commit the resulting +Gemfile.lock+ to your source code respository.

<shell>
$ bundle update spree_social
</shell>

Now its time to fire up Spree and make sure everything is working properly.  Assuming everything looks good you'll also want to update the +Versionfile+ associated with your extension so that people can use the new and improved version.

In our example we're adding support for a new 0.60.0RC1 release candidate which is equivalent to 0.60.x in the extension directory.

<ruby>
"0.60.x" => { :tag => "v1.2", :version => "1.2" }
"0.50.x" => { :tag => "v1.0.2", :version => "1.0.2" }
</ruby>

If we're not 100% sure the extension will support the release candidate (or if its a work in progress) we could reference the "edge" branch (ie. master) in the +Versionfile+ instead.

<ruby>
"0.60.x" => { :branch => "master" }
"0.50.x" => { :tag => "v1.0.2", :version => "1.0.2" }
</ruby>

INFO: Using a branch in the +Versionfile+ designates the gem as a "development release" which is possibly unstable and subject to change.  Once things are stable you can point ot a specific Git SHA or tag so that people can rely on the extension not changing in a production release.

h3. Extension Tutorial

This tutorial assumes a basic familiarity with Spree extensions.  For more detailed information on how extensions, please see the previous sections. The tutorial will, however, walk you through a complete example touching on all of the major aspects of an extension so if you like to learn through "step by step" instructions you may want to start here.

h4. Getting Started

Let’s start by building a simple extension. Suppose we want the ability to mark certain products as part of a promotion. We’d like to add an admin interface for marking certain items as being part of the promotion. We’d also like to highlight these products in our store view. This is a great example of how an extension can be used to build on the solid Spree foundation. We’ll be adding our own custom models, views, controllers, routes and locales via the new extension.

We're going to assume you already have a functioning Spree application.  If you have not yet achieved this you should read the "Getting Started Guide":getting_started.html first.

So let's start by generating the new extension

<shell>
  $ rails g spree:extension FlagPromotions
</shell>

This creates a +flag_promotions+ directory with several additional files and directories as the following generator output shows:

<ruby>
   create  flag_promotions
   create  flag_promotions/db
   create  flag_promotions/public
   create  flag_promotions/LICENSE
   create  flag_promotions/Rakefile
   create  flag_promotions/README.md
   create  flag_promotions/.gitignore
   create  flag_promotions/flag_promotions.gemspec
   create  flag_promotions/lib/tasks/install.rake
   create  flag_promotions/app
   create  flag_promotions/app/controllers
   create  flag_promotions/app/helpers
   create  flag_promotions/app/models
   create  flag_promotions/app/views
   create  flag_promotions/spec
    exist  flag_promotions/lib
   create  flag_promotions/lib/flag_promotions_hooks.rb
   create  flag_promotions/lib/tasks/flag_promotions.rake
   create  flag_promotions/lib/flag_promotions.rb
   create  flag_promotions/spec/spec_helper.rb
  gemfile  flag_promotions
</ruby>

h4. Creating a Model

Lets create a new +PromotedItem+ model for our extension.  Unfortunately Rails does not yet provide an easy mechanism for generating models, etc. within the context of your extension.  So for now you are left to create the necessary files manually or to use the standard Rails generator and copy the files into your extension.

NOTE: Rails 3.1 will contain better mechanisms for extending the Rails generators so you won't have to resort to manual file creation or other hacks once Spree supports this future release.

The +PromotedItem+ model will represent products that are "flagged" for promotion on the front page along with a schedule of when the promotion begins and ends.

<ruby>
  # flag_promotions/app/models/promoted_item.rb

  class PromotedItem < ActiveRecord::Base

  end
</ruby>

And of course we'll need a corresponding migration.  Until there is an extension migration generator you can use the Rails generator and copy the migration into your extension as a workaround.

<ruby>
  # flag_promotions/db/migrate/20101024002242_create_promoted_items.rb

  class CreatePromotedItems < ActiveRecord::Migration
    def self.up
      create_table :promoted_items do |t|
        t.string :description
        t.references :product
        t.date :start
        t.date :stop
      end
    end

    def self.down
      drop_table :promoted_items
    end
  end
</ruby>

Extension migrations need to be copied from the engine into the main Rails application.  You can do this with a convenient rake task.

<shell>
  $ rake flag_promotions:install
</shell>

NOTE: This also copies over public assets in your engines +public+ directory.  If you just want the migrations you can run +rake flag_promotions:install:migrations+ or if you just want the assets you can run +rake flag_promotions:install:assets+.

INFO: The +install.rake+ file is automatically created for you by the Spree extension generator.  It will only be necessary until Rails 3.1 is released - at which point this task will be provided "automagically."

h4. Creating a Controller and View

Now lets create a new controller file so that we can administer these promoted items.

<ruby>
  # flag_promotions/app/controllers/admin/promoted_items_controller.rb
  class Admin::PromotedItemsController < Admin::ResourceController

  end
</ruby>

You may notice the base class is now using Admin::ResourceController, this is a major change for Spree 0.60.x and later. Previous versions used a gem called resource_controller to provide an implementation of a controllers CRUD methods, but this gem is no longer being actively maintained and also provides unnecessary features that Spree was not using.

So now the Admin::ResourceController is an interal Spree class that provides a similiar (but much simplied) implementation of these CRUD actions. We strongly recommend that only basic Admin controllers use this base class, and any front-end or custom / advanced methods be manually defined within the controllers implementation itself.

Lets also add a corresponding admin view for this new resource.

<shell>
  $ cd flag_promotions
  $ mkdir -p app/views/admin
  $ vi promoted_items_controller.html.erb
</shell>

_TODO: Provide some actual view code.  We'll skip it for now since its pretty trivial._

h4. Configure Routes

Your new resource will not be accessible in your Spree application until you map some routing information for it.  So we'll update the +config/routes.rb+ file as follows

<ruby>
  Rails.application.routes.draw do
    namespace :admin do
      resources :promoted_items
    end
  end
</ruby>

We should now be in a position to verify the correct configuration of the extension.  Start your Spree application and then navigate to "http://localhost:3000/admin/promoted_items":http://localhost:3000/admin/promoted_items and verify that the view you created is displayed.

h4. Customizing an Existing Spree View

Please see the "View Customization":view_customization.html pages for details.

h4. Internationalization (I18n)

Spree extensions can also provide their own locales/translations.  If you're adding additional view text and you wish to support multiple locales, or if you are interested in sharing your extension with others, its a good idea to enable your extension with the i18n features of Spree.

In order to properly display the "Promoted Items" tab we'll need to provide an English localization in the +config/locales/en.yml+ file.

<ruby>
  ---
  en:
    promoted_items: Promoted Items
</ruby>

h4. Overriding an Existing Spree Class

Please refer to the "Logic Customization":logic_customization.html page.
