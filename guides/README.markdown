The guides are written in [Textile]() and there is information on the [spree-guides wiki](http://wiki.github.com/schof/spree-guides) on the general style to use when writing a guide.  Please stick to the established format and feel free to ask questions on [spree-user](http://groups.google.com/group/spree-user) or #spree if you have any questions. 

To build the entire set of guides simply run the following command

<pre><code>
rake guides
</code></pre>
            
Output will be generated in the `output` directory.

Spree is a complete open source commerce solution for Ruby on Rails.  It was developed by Sean Schofield in an effort to build a superior ecommerce platform for the Rails community.
